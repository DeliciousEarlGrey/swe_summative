# swe_summative: DeepFoot

DeepFoot is an educational tool that showcases the potential of machine learning and web development technologies in creating interactive and predictive applications. Ot uses a machine learning model trained on historical Premier League match data to predict the outcomes of upcoming matches on a week-by-week basis.

The frontend of the application provides a user-friendly interface where users can select a specific matchweek and view the predicted results for each match. The predictions include the likelihood of a home win/draw or an away win/draw, expressed as percentages.

The backend invloves a logistic regression model trained on various features such as team performance, goals scored, and previous season points. The model is continuously updated with the latest match data (obtained via API calls to football-data.org) to provide accurate predictions.

DeepFoot is designed to be used as an educational resource, demonstrating how machine learning algorithms can be integrated with web technologies to create practical and interactive applications. It aims to inspire and educate individuals about the possibilities and potential of combining these technologies in solving real-world problems.
